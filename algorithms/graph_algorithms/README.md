#  Typical algorithms in Yufu Chen's class in UCAS
    Implement all algorithms in class by hand based on C++ STL.

## 1. Chapter2 - Graph algorithms

### 1.0 Data strctures
#### 1.0.1 graph
    The library of graph. Here we have DenseGraph(Stored in adjacent matrix) and SparseGraph(Stored in adjacent list). For the chapter >= 1.1, we have serveral graph algorithms called 'xxSolver'.

### 1.1 cut_vertex
    This is the tarjan algorithm of finding cutting vertices.
